# Brain Tumor Detection, Classification & Segmentation

This project provides a deep learning pipeline for analyzing brain MRI images. It includes:

- ✅ Binary Tumor Classification (Tumor vs. No Tumor)
- ✅ Tumor Type Identification (Meningioma, Glioma, Pituitary)
- ✅ Semantic Segmentation of tumor regions using a custom-built UNet
- ✅ Streamlit App for browser-based interaction

## Getting Started
